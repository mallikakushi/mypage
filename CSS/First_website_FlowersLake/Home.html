	 <p> Flowers are a gift to this earth.
	 As Gerard De Nerval once said, “Every flower is a soul blossoming in nature.”
	 They paint contrasting colors along the ground and bring joy to many. Their elegance and delicate touches have us all in awe and exhilaration. 
	 This is often why flowers are seen as loving gifts for the special people in our lives, and the reaction of the person receiving the flowers is priceless.
